//##Intermediate Operations
//When you look into map(), distinct(), sort(), filter() etc are returns a stream. 
//So all these options are returning a stream. So the methods that returns a stream are called intermediate operations 

//##Terminal Operations
//When you look into forEach() it returns void and look at  Collect() or reduce() it returns a specific type like list or map or int etc
//So the methods that returns void or any other specific type but not stream as return are called terminal operations
